"Essential is a âœŒ*quality of life*âœŒclosed source mod that adds features to Minecraft Java that can be done with other FOSS mods."

Disecting every claim made by Essential and providing better open-source alternatives.

"Host singleplayer worlds and invite your friends."
- Instead use [e4mc](https://e4mc.link/), which is even easier to use

"Customize your character with cosmetic items."
- What they don't say is that these cosmetics cost actual money, this is on par with people buying those discord avatar decorations ðŸ’€
    - Just use [Figura](https://modrinth.com/mod/figura) 
    - or [Customizable Player Models](https://modrinth.com/plugin/custom-player-models)

"Take, edit, and share screenshots in-game."
- Just use a external screenshot tool like [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/)
- Want to send them ingame? Just use [ChatImage](https://modrinth.com/mod/chatimage)

"Connect with friends in-game like never before."
- Use a discord group chat silly goose
    - Don't like Discord? Use Matrix or IRC if your old

Claims not featured on the website:

"Better preformance, its just like Optifine"
- Just use [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized)

### What I do
I'm a hobbyist programmer whos been programming for around 5 years in multiple languages and frameworks.
- I'm highly proficent in [Lua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)) and [Luau](https://luau-lang.org/) (Roblox's flavor of Lua)
    - I've worked on several Roblox games such as [Universal Guardians](https://www.roblox.com/games/8698405129/Universal-Guardians-BETA) and [Facility](https://www.roblox.com/games/6052240333/Facility-HORROR)
    - Have worked with almost every mainstream roblox framework, api and library including [Rojo](https://rojo.space/), [Knit](https://sleitnick.github.io/Knit/), [Promise](https://eryn.io/roblox-lua-promise/), [ProfileService](https://madstudioroblox.github.io/ProfileService/), [DataStore2](https://kampfkarren.github.io/Roblox/), [Fusion](https://elttob.uk/Fusion/0.2/), and a bit of [Roact](https://roblox.github.io/roact/)
- Fairly decent at [Python](https://www.python.org/), frequently use it for very specific tasks
- Know a bit of [Java](https://www.java.com/en/), have worked on porting a [Minecraft Forge Mod](https://github.com/KnownSH/Cyclic-Fabric) to [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) using Java.
- Some HTML/CSS/JS as you can probably see[^2]
- Some other languages i'm familiar with are [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))

Other than programming, I also do
- Raw NASA image processing (for fun)
- 3D modeling in both Blender and Fusion 360
- Photoshop image processing
- Some drawing

Theres likely a whole lot I missed in this list but thats most of it.

### Facts and whatnot
- Massive spaceflight nerd, borderline chronic
    - I enjoy the [RL10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RL10)
    - I'm quite interested in space imagery, even made [a whole iceberg chart](https://icebergcharts.com/i/Interesting_Space_Imagery) just about space images.

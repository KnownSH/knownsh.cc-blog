  - I've worked with almost every mainstream Roblox framework, API, and library, including:
    - [Rojo](https://rojo.space/)

    - [Fusion](https://elttob.uk/Fusion/0.2/)
    - [Roact](https://roblox.github.io/roact/)

&nbsp;

### Decent in:

- Massive spaceflight nerd, borderline chronic
    - I enjoy the [RL10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RL10)
    - I'm quite interested in space imagery, even made [a whole iceberg chart](https://icebergcharts.com/i/Interesting_Space_Imagery) just about space images.
- If you want to draw "me", for some reason, [my reference art is hosted on this website](/reference)
